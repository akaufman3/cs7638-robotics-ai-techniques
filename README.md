Robotics: Artificial Intelligence Techniques study materials I compiled

Class Description: "In Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, learn from Sebastian Thrun, the leader of Google and Stanford's autonomous driving team, how to program all the major systems of a robotic car. This class will teach students basic methods in Artificial Intelligence, including probabilistic inference, planning and search, localization, tracking, mapping and control, all with a focus on robotics. Extensive programming examples and assignments will apply these methods in the context of building self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles.  

Students will be expected to complete six problem sets and multiple projects that apply the methods learned in this class."
